    "\n",
    "Q3.Is python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "ans:-Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too. You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers. It is always good to use names that are more easily understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.What is the correct extension of python file?\n",

    "\n",
    "Q5.Name a few blocks of code used to define in python language?\n",
    "ans:-The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each command typed interactively is a block. A script file (a file given as standard input to the interpreter or specified as a command line argument to the interpreter) is a code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.Is python code compiled or interprated?\n",
    "ans:-Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7.State a character usedto give single-line comments in python?\n",
    "ans:-We can write a single-line comment by adding a single # character before any statement or line of code\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8.Mention functions which can help us to find theversion of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "ans:-Explanation: The function sys. version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on. It also contains information on the build number and compiler used. For example, 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9.Python is supports the anonymeus function at runtime,using a construct called\n",
    "ans:-Python supports to make anonymous functions which are not bound to a name(@ runtime). It uses a construct called \"lambda\" .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10.What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "ans:-Developed in 2008, pip (an acronym of “pip Install Packages”) is today the standard tool for installing Python packages and their dependencies in a secure manner. Most recent distributions of Python come with pip preinstalled. Python 2.7. 9 and Python 3.4 and later versions include pip by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11.Mention a few built -in function in python?\n",
    "ans:-SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on ____. Pandas; Matplotlib; NumPy; All of the mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12.What is the maximum possible of an identifier in python?\n",
    "ans:- An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. Python is one of the most popular programming languages. Guido van Rossum created it, and it was released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13.What are the benifits of using python\n",
    "ans:-These are following benifits of using python are:-\n",
    "     Data science.\n",
    "Scientific and mathematical computing.\n",
    "Web development.\n",
    "Finance and trading.\n",
    "System automation and administration.\n",
    "Computer graphics.\n",
    "Basic game development.\n",
    "Security and penetration testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14.How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "ans:-Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15.How to install python on windows and set path variables?\n",
    "ans:-The complete path of python.exe can be added by:\n",
    "Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.\n",
    "Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.\n",
    "Clicking on the Environment Variables button o​n the bottom right.\n",
    "In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16.Is identatation required in python?\n",
    "ans:-Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n"
